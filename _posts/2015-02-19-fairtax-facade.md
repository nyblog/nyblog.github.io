How many of you all think you pay too much tax? Common raise those hands! I know many people feel this way. I do too. However the solution is not the “Fair Tax”. Let me begin by explaining what the Fair Tax is. Essentially what is called for by the proponents of such a tax is a universal sales tax coupled with the repeal of the 16th amendment and an abolition of all other federal and state taxes (property, income, corporate, estate, etc.) This is an awful idea. If this tax were to be implemented under current federal, state and local spending patterns the tax itself would have to be in excess of 100%. This means that the next time you go to the store to buy that new 400 video game system instead of paying the normal $400 you’ll be paying somewhere between $800-$900. Nobody wants that. Another problem with this so called “Fair Tax” Is that it is not fair. It doesn’t even approach fair. Because one only pays taxes on what they spend richer individuals pay a smaller portion of their income in tax. Let’s imagine we have two families both with three members. Family A has an income of $50,000 and family B has an income of 500,000,000. Let’s also assume that Family A doesn’t save any money and that the sales tax rate is 100%. If all of the money that family A makes is spent at retail outlets then the total amount of money they paid to the government would equal 50% of their income. Compare this to the rich family that spends 50 million in a given year. They pay only 5% of their income in tax. This is markedly unfair because people who have a lesser capacity to pay are expected to contribute a greater portion of their income than individuals who are oozing money. Many supporters of the tax say that a deduction of 100% of the poverty line would be all that would be needed to make the system fair. This is also untrue because even if such a deduction were implemented you would still have higher income individuals paying less tax as a percent of their income than poor individuals. Another problem with this tax is that it discourages consumption. This is a problem because our economy is based entirely on the consumption of goods and services by individuals. Not only would the “Fair Tax” result in an unfair tax code but it would also stifle growth. If we really wanted a fairer tax system we should remove the capital gains tax and apply the same marginal rate to all income, where ever that income was derived.

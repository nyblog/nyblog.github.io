When you look at this chart of U.S. customary units of length, you'll see exactly why [every other country in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma) has adopted the metric system:

After finding this chart [on Quora](http://qr.ae/EhYvf), I remembered having once noticed that the relationships between the customary units for fluid volume and the metric system. They're all related by powers of 2.

* 1 tablespoon (Tbsp) = 4 fluid drams (fl dr)
* 1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 2 Tbsp = 8 fl dr
* 1 gill (gi) = 4 fl oz = 8 Tbsp = 32 fl dr
* 1 cup (c) = 2 gi = 8 fl oz = 16 Tbsp = 64 fl dr
* 1 pint (pt) = 2 c = 4 gi = 16 fl oz = 32 Tbsp = 128 fl dr
* 1 quart (qt) = 2 pt = 4 c = 8 gi = 32 fl oz = 64 Tbsp = 256 fl dr
* 1 gallon (gal) = 4 qt = 8 pt = 16 c = 32 gi = 128 fl oz = 256 Tbsp = 1024 fl dr

The system isn't perfect, however; it skips powers of two and includes some units that aren't powers of two, such as the teaspoon (1/3 of a fluid ounce) and the shot (1.5 fl oz). 'Murica.
